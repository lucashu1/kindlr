CS 310 Project 2: Kindlr

Sprint 1:
Edit profile in UI: The user is now able to go to his/her profile and edit his/her email, password, etc. The changes appear in Firebase as well.
Partial Firebase refactoring: 
Book filtering in UI: There is now a text box in the main swiping screen that allows the user to provide a search query, which the backend then uses to filter books to display to the user based on author, genre, etc.
Access notifications screen: Users are now able to view their notifications menu to see matches that they have made with other users.
Email notifications: Upon “matching” with another user, users now receive email notifications describing the match, and next steps.
Book pictures in UI: When posting books, users are now prompted for a book image URL. The book image is then displayed on the main swiping screen for other users to see.
